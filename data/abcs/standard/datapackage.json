Additional information on ABCs methods and surveillance population is available at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/methodology/index.html. Analyze and visualize data using the ABCs Bact Facts Interactive Data Dashboard at https://www.cdc.gov/abcs/bact-facts-interactive-dashboard. *ABCs IPD Isolates were serotyped by Quellung, PCR, or whole genome sequencing (WGS). **Cases without an isolate available or with mixed serotypes reported are listed on the table as “MISS.” Additionally, non-typeable IPD cases are shown as “NT.” ***Zero cell rows were not included in this dataset. ****Minor changes to previous years' serotype data can occur as additional isolates and serotype data become available. *****Cases were excluded from this dataset if the ABCs site did not perform surveillance in the catchment area for a full calendar year. As a result, cases were excluded from the following sites: TN, 11 counties, Jul-Dec 1999; CO, 5 counties, Jul-Dec 2000; CA, 2 counties (aged <5 years), Oct-Dec 2000.",
