The baseline is the 10th percentile of the log-transformed and normalized concentration values, which is calculated within a {variant.norm_frequency}. This is then scaled, where e is the mathmatical constant, and x is the number of standard deviations: $VAL = e^{x}$ These values are categorized as very low, low, moderate, high, or very high using the following breakpoints: {variant.breakpoints}.",
